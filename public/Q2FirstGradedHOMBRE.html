                            <p class="imageflexcontent">Hellmet is a First Person Shooter game on Roblox based off the Dummies vs Noobs universe (another game on Roblox) and Hellmet revolves around the story of Fireteam 6 from the side of the Noobs. Unlike most first person shooters, Hellmet utilizes the perspective of a recording from a helmet camera and the player/s play with such a perspective. In Fireteam 6, there are 3 members: Aradus, Kaska and Calar. These members will be explained shortly after.</p>

                        <h1 id="Aradus">Operator Aradus</h1>
                        <div class="imageflex">

                          <p>Aradus is one of the playable characters that a player can choose in Hellmet, often described as the "Squad Leader"/"NCO" of Fireteam 6. He often changes uniforms and speaks in a mature and professional way (unlike his peers). His standard issue rifle is a variation of the in real life Honey Badger chambered in either .300 Blackout or 5.56x45. The image on the left is one of the pickable firearms in the game, its real life equivalent is a polymer M14 chambered in 7.62 NATO calibers. A fun fact about this firearm is that it is a service rifle for the current Philippine military (most especially CAFGU and ROTC units) and is classified as a Battle Rifle by most gun enthusiasts around the world. </p>

                        <h1 id="Kaska">Operator Kaska</h1>
                        <div class ="imageflex">
                        <img src="../assets/OpKaska.png" alt="Aradus" width="242">
                        <p>"Kaska is also one of the playable characters, often seen as "the right hand man" of Aradus, he is also an operator of Fireteam 6. His standard issue rifle is also a variation of the modern day Honeybadger. There is not much to take note from Kaska's character as he simply obeys the orders of Aradus and is moreso a supporting character in the story. The firearm carried by Kaska on the image on the left is the Honey Badger (their supposed standard issue rifle). In this image, he surprisingly does not wear a helmet unlike his usual operations in urban zones.</p>

                        <h1 id="Calar">Operator Calar</h1>
                        <div class ="imageflex">
                          <img src="../assets/OpCalar.png" alt="Calar" width="242">
                        <p>Operator Calar is one of the playable characters, seen as the reckless amateur of the squad. He is a teenager who joined the Army because Fireteams were running out of infantry and met both Kaska and Aradus in the map of Decovenant where they fought their way out of the building avoiding enemy forces. A fun fact about Calar is that he is actually a minor with his age being only 17 years old, this practice is commonplace around the world and even in the Philippines. All a 16-17 year old needs to join the military is consent from their parents/guardians. His firearm is the famous AK74.</p>
